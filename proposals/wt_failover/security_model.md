# Executable security model

The current self-contained-Ping checks are in
[boomlet_rollover_model.md](boomlet_rollover_model.md). The handoff and capsule
experiments below check general ordering hazards, not the current recovery
candidate. Their version string is a test fixture, not an additional selected
protocol version. No continuously online recorder is selected by the candidate.

This bounded model checks protocol ordering with one continuously honest logical
peer and four adversarial cosigners. Signatures and storage protection are
authenticated abstractions. The existing decision checker supplies the voting
state machine; its source digest is printed with the results. The additional
model source is retained below as part of the proposal.

Run from the repository root with Python 3.10 or later. This creates no files and
does not render diagrams.

```sh
python3 -B - <<'PY'
from pathlib import Path
document = Path('wt_failover/security_model.md').read_text()
source = document.split('```python\n', 1)[1].split('\n```', 1)[0]
exec(compile(source, 'wt_failover/security_model.md', 'exec'))
PY
```

The searches exhaust their reachable finite graphs. Crash and duplicate actions
preserve committed state. Ambiguous physical writes must lock the device; their
hardware implementation is outside the model. The inherited voting search
allows ballot jumps as a conservative enlargement of the proposal's
successor-only rule. It uses three ballots and every justified recovery choice.

The intent search admits two competing five-intent combinations sharing the
honest peer's intent. The combined search includes one WT decision, source
freeze, target staging, release preparation, retirement, cancellation and one
subsequent target progress event. That last event abstracts an independently
validated ordinary operation and changes the head, usage and retained archive.
The capsule search permits arbitrary host substitution, interrupted copies and
replays, with two complete copy attempts. A third copy is reachable only in its
negative control. Six snapshot classes per peer produce 7,776 lifecycle cases;
each is checked under all 31 nonempty sets of honest peers.

These bounds do not cover all successive handoffs, arbitrary message schedules,
the complete transaction parser or physical side channels. See the
[verification report](security_verification.md) for the security argument,
findings and remaining work.
