## Purpose

This document is the repository's threat-model-oriented register. It collects the security-relevant assumptions and proof-scope limits that the Boomerang design and formalization rely on, then derives a design-gaps table from those security-relevant boundaries only.

The goal is not to restate the protocol. The goal is to answer:

1. What must be true for the design's security claims to hold?
2. Which assumptions are strong, underspecified, operational, or contradicted by the prototype materials?
3. What concrete design gaps follow from those assumptions?

### Files reviewed but not directly assumption-bearing

- `security_models/wips/setup/README.md` is empty.
- `security_models/wips/withdrawal/README.md` is empty.
- `LICENSE` is legal metadata and adds no security-design assumptions.
- The SVG renders above mostly duplicate the corresponding PlantUML semantics and were checked for consistency.

## Method

An item was entered into the register when at least one of the following was true:

- the repo states the assumption directly;
- the security story cannot hold without the assumption;
- a WIP integrity/freshness artifact shows the protocol is relying on that assumption transitively;
- the prototype hardware material shows tension between the desired trust model and the named parts.

## Status Legend

- `Explicit`: stated directly in the repo.
- `Implicit`: necessary for the design to work, but not stated as a first-class assumption.
- `Open/WIP`: acknowledged in the repo as unresolved, deferred, or ancillary.
- `Resolved`: closed by the cited specification or ADR work.
- `Prototype tension`: the repository assumes something stronger than the referenced prototype hardware or process supports.

## High-Level Observations Before The Register

- Many core security guarantees are assumption-heavy: Boomlet behavior, ST integrity, peer cooperation, SAR and WT availability, and user rollover discipline.
- The specification uses `setup_instance_id`, chained setup checkpoints, `withdrawal_id`, `approved_withdrawal_id`, directional channel contexts, approval-set attestations, and exact SAR placeholder acknowledgements to close several integrity and binding gaps.
- The WIP freshness sheet shows some messages with explicit freshness guarantors and some with no direct freshness guarantor or freshness inferred from broader context.
- The hardware materials for the ST prototype emphasize flexibility, bootloader/debug access, exposed connectors, and prototyping convenience. The ST design doc assumes a much more appliance-like trust model.
- Several hard gaps remain open: forced determinism, Boomletwo activation, ancillary procedures, jurisdictional rescue limits, and final parameter selection.

## Assumption Register

### A. Baseline Security Scope And Canonical Trust Boundaries

| ID | Assumption | Sources | If False | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AR-01 | `SPEC.md`, Markdown docs, ADRs, and sequence diagrams are internally consistent enough to define one security-relevant setup and withdrawal meaning for the deliverable. | `SPEC`, `R`, `DD`, `SU`, `WD`, `SP`, `WI`, `WN`, `ADR` | Different components or future implementations may satisfy different security semantics while all claiming to implement "Boomerang". | Explicit |
| AR-03 | The security story is centered on the exactly five-peer, 5-of-5 Boomerang profile described in the docs. | `SPEC`, `R`, `DD`, `SM` | Claims about one honest peer preserving Boomerang guarantees would not generalize. | Explicit |
| AR-04 | The separate PoC and any implementation will preserve the same trust boundaries and message semantics described here. | `R`, `DD` | The register would not describe the system that actually gets built. | Implicit |
| AR-05 | Security-critical properties deferred to ancillaries, implementation detail, or operator discipline can be postponed without invalidating the design-stage security story. | `DD`, `SM` | Real-world safety and integrity may depend on unresolved implementation and operating assumptions more than the design narrative admits. | Open/WIP |

### B. Bitcoin, Descriptor, And Timing Model

| ID | Assumption | Sources | If False | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AR-06 | Bitcoin consensus, timelocks, and Taproot spending conditions behave as modeled by the descriptor design. | `R`, `DD`, `SM` | Both non-deterministic and fallback security claims may be wrong. | Explicit |
| AR-07 | `milestone_block_collection` is well-formed, strictly ordered, and operationally sensible. | `SU`, `SP`, `SM` | Users can enter fallback too early, or funds can become awkwardly or prematurely spendable. | Implicit |
| AR-08 | Withdrawal only starts after `milestone_block_0`, and all parties agree on that fact. | `WD`, `WI`, `WN`, `DD` | Protocol state can diverge or enter unintended pre-milestone behavior. | Explicit |
| AR-09 | Users will roll funds into a new Boomerang setup before deterministic fallback makes coercion timing predictable. | `FD`, `R`, `DD` | Boomerang degrades into a known-timeline withdrawal system. | Explicit |
| AR-10 | Reorgs are shallow or rare enough that a "most work block height" view is a safe enough synchronization primitive for the design. | `SM`, `WI`, `WN`, `BD` | Freshness checks, milestone gating, and counter progression can all be evaluated on stale or reversible chain state. | Open/WIP |
| AR-11 | Niso and WT obtain accurate enough block height and chain context from their configured Bitcoin node(s). | `R`, `SU`, `WD`, `SM` | A bad node can skew timing, approvals, and liveness decisions. | Implicit |
| AR-12 | Fee estimation and PSBT hydration remain viable even after a possibly long withdrawal ceremony. | `WD`, `DD` | A valid intent may become economically or practically unsignable by the time signing starts. | Implicit |
| AR-13 | The ping-pong "digging game" usually terminates before deterministic fallback if users start in time. | `R`, `DD`, `FD`, `BD` | The main coercion-resistance promise collapses into forced determinism. | Open/WIP |
| AR-14 | Freshness tolerances can be tuned to cover block irregularity, network delay, user sleep, time zones, and SAR/WT latency without breaking liveness. | `BD`, `DD`, `WIP-WF`, `WIP-WI` | Honest executions will fail freshness checks, or malicious delay becomes too easy. | Open/WIP |

### C. Cryptography, Serialization, And Binding

| ID | Assumption | Sources | If False | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AR-15 | Schnorr, MuSig2, ECDH, tagged hashing, SP 800-108 CMAC KDF, AES-256-CBC/PKCS#7, and AES-CMAC encrypt-then-MAC are secure as specified and implemented. | `SPEC`, `R`, `DD`, `SU`, `WD`, `DP`, `ADR` | Core funds, identity, and duress guarantees fail. | Explicit |
| AR-16 | Every component serializes and interprets the same canonical message content identically. | `SPEC`, `SU`, `WD`, `SP`, `WI`, `WN` | Signatures, CMACs, and identifiers can validate over mismatched semantics, or peers can disagree about what was approved. | Implicit |
| AR-17 | RNG quality is sufficient across Boomlet, ST, WT, SAR, and supporting hardware. | `R`, `DD`, `DP`, `ST`, `HW-H7` | Mystery, nonces, keys, and duress spaces can be biased or predictable. | Explicit |
| AR-18 | Nonces, setup and withdrawal scope IDs, chained setup checkpoints, sequence numbers, freshness checks, and SAR replay tuples are sufficient replay protection for the message set. | `SPEC`, `DP`, `WD`, `DD`, `WIP-WF`, `ADR` | Old approvals, checks, placeholders, or commitments may be replayed into new contexts. | Explicit |
| AR-19 | `tx_id`, `withdrawal_id`, `approved_withdrawal_id`, approval-set attestations, signing-package verification, and final transaction revalidation are strong enough to anchor transaction-authorization correctness throughout the ceremony. | `SPEC`, `WD`, `WI`, `WN`, `DD` | A participant may believe they are approving one spend while another spend is actually signed. | Explicit |
| AR-20 | Fresh CBC IVs, context-bound SAR placeholder envelopes, status-free acknowledgements, and timing/error discipline make safe placeholders and duress placeholders indistinguishable to WT and external observers within the specified protocol surface. | `SPEC`, `DP`, `WD`, `DCW` | WT or an observer can learn whether duress was signaled from ciphertext behavior, acknowledgement behavior, or service-visible side effects. | Explicit |
| AR-21 | `doxing_key_for_sar -> doxing_data_identifier` is unique enough operationally to locate the right setup-bound SAR record without ambiguity. | `SPEC`, `SU`, `DP`, `SM` | SAR may fail to rescue the right user or may treat malformed inputs incorrectly. | Implicit |

### D. Boomlet And Boomletwo

| ID | Assumption | Sources | If False | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AR-22 | Boomlet private key shares and identity keys are truly non-exportable. | `R`, `SM`, `DD` | The Boomerang regime can be bypassed or cloned. | Explicit |
| AR-23 | Boomlet's `counter`, `mystery`, and reach-state cannot be read, reset, cloned, or externally accelerated. | `R`, `DD`, `FD`, `SM` | Non-determinism becomes knowable or controllable by an attacker. | Implicit |
| AR-24 | Boomlet faithfully enforces one-way state such as "reached mystery" and does not regress after a flag is set. | `WD`, `WI`, `WN` | Peers can be desynchronized or coerced into incorrect liveness behavior. | Implicit |
| AR-25 | Boomlet can preserve state for months of coordinated ping/pong updates and then safely clear withdrawal-specific state after signing. | `WD`, `DD` | The ceremony may fail midstream or leak stale state into later withdrawals. | Implicit |
| AR-26 | Java Card-class hardware can perform the required cryptography and state updates within practical time and endurance limits. | `DD`, `FD` | The protocol becomes too slow, too fragile, or impossible to execute as designed. | Open/WIP |
| AR-27 | Backing up Boomlet state without copying the active `mystery`, and requiring Boomletwo to generate its own mystery after authenticated import, is sufficient to preserve intended liveness and security properties before activation is defined. | `SPEC`, `SM`, `SU`, `DD` | The backup may either weaken non-determinism or fail to give useful recovery. | Implicit |
| AR-28 | Only one of Boomlet and Boomletwo will ever be active, although activation/deactivation is unspecified. | `R`, `SM`, `DD` | Duplicate active devices or confused ownership can undermine both safety and liveness. | Open/WIP |
| AR-29 | Losing both Boomlet and Boomletwo is rare enough that fallback-only recovery remains acceptable. | `FD`, `DD` | Funds protection depends too heavily on rare but catastrophic device loss patterns. | Implicit |
| AR-30 | Secure-element supply chain, lifecycle, and side-channel properties are acceptable for a Bitcoin custody system. | `R`, `DD`, `SM` | A hidden hardware weakness can destroy the central Boomerang guarantee. | Explicit |

### E. Secure Terminal And Human Interface

| ID | Assumption | Sources | If False | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AR-31 | ST is the trusted UI for verification and duress input; Niso is not. | `R`, `DP`, `ST`, `SM` | Duress signaling and user verification reduce to whatever the online host shows. | Explicit |
| AR-32 | ST securely generates, stores, and uses its long-term keys. | `ST`, `DP`, `DCS` | An attacker can read or alter the ST-Boomlet channel. | Explicit |
| AR-33 | ST displays exact Boomlet-authored content and its joystick records exact user intent. | `ST`, `DP`, `DCW` | Users can be tricked into false safe or false duress outcomes. | Explicit |
| AR-34 | ST remains air-gapped except for the intended QR exchange path. | `R`, `ST`, `DP` | Malware-capable connectivity can directly exfiltrate consent-set or duress data. | Explicit |
| AR-35 | An attacker cannot practically observe both the ST display and the user's selection behavior well enough to learn the consent set under coercion. | `DP`, `ST` | Plausible deniability degrades, and attackers can demand the true safe response. | Explicit |
| AR-36 | Users can memorize the consent set and reliably reproduce it under stress, fatigue, or coercion. | `DP`, `SU`, `DCS` | False duress or false safe outcomes become common. | Implicit |
| AR-37 | One ST per peer is enough for ongoing operation, although ST replacement remains ancillary. | `DP`, `DD` | ST loss or compromise becomes an operational dead end. | Open/WIP |
| AR-38 | A DIY Portenta-based ST can be made tamper-evident/tamper-resistant enough to satisfy the repo's trust model. | `ST`, `HW-BB`, `HW-H7` | The assumed trusted UI is only a prototype dev kit with insufficient hardening. | Prototype tension |
| AR-39 | Prototype attack surface exposed by bootloader, USB, JTAG, Ethernet, SD, camera, and other breakout/debug features can be controlled by build and ops choices. | `HW-BB`, `HW-H7`, `ST` | The proposed ST platform may remain much easier to tamper with than the security model assumes. | Prototype tension |

### F. Iso, Niso, And Phone Environments

| ID | Assumption | Sources | If False | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AR-40 | Iso runs in a truly isolated and trusted environment. | `R`, `DD`, `SM`, `SU` | Normal keys, mnemonic material, and approval checks become host-compromise targets. | Explicit |
| AR-41 | User-provided entropy, mnemonic handling, and passphrase handling on Iso are safe and high quality. | `SU`, `DD`, `WIP-LD` | Normal key security collapses independently of Boomlet. | Implicit |
| AR-42 | Niso can be distrusted for duress integrity while remaining trusted for transport, hydration, routing, and local coordination. | `R`, `WD`, `ST` | The protocol leaves an online component with more power than the threat model admits. | Implicit |
| AR-43 | Niso's RPC endpoint is honest, reachable, and configured correctly. | `R`, `SU`, `WD`, `SM` | Block height, satisfiability, and freshness decisions can be manipulated. | Implicit |
| AR-44 | Phone OS/app security is good enough for dynamic doxing collection and SAR registration. | `R`, `DD`, `SU`, `DP` | Rescue data can be stale, forged, leaked, or suppressed. | Explicit |
| AR-45 | Phone-to-SAR registration, payment, and sync cannot be silently redirected or spoofed in a way the user will miss. | `SU`, `WIP-SI` | The user can think they are covered while SAR never received valid rescue data. | Implicit |
| AR-45A | `doxing_password` is user-chosen; Boomlet receives `doxing_key` and does not enforce password policy. | `SPEC`, `ADR`, `SM` | Setup or backup may depend on a second mnemonic-length secret, or components may diverge on password-policy enforcement. | Explicit |
| AR-46 | Users can safely shuttle Boomlet between Iso and Niso without plugging the wrong device into the wrong host or mixing peer hardware. | `SU`, `WD`, `DD` | Cross-device confusion can undermine both safety and liveness. | Implicit |
| AR-47 | Missing change procedures for Phone, Niso, and ST can be deferred to ancillaries without invalidating the current design. | `DD` | Operational device loss or replacement breaks the system before production readiness is even assessed. | Open/WIP |

### G. Peers, Users, And Human Operations

| ID | Assumption | Sources | If False | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AR-48 | At least one honest peer exists in the N-of-N Boomerang regime. | `R`, `SM`, `DD` | The "one honest peer preserves the promise" argument disappears. | Explicit |
| AR-49 | Peers honestly exchange and verify peer IDs and Tor addresses out of band. | `R`, `SU`, `SP`, `SM` | Impersonation or routing attacks can be injected before Tor is even used. | Explicit |
| AR-50 | Users and peers meaningfully verify ordered peer setup records, WT order, milestone blocks, `setup_instance_id`, transaction identifiers, and peer data when prompted. | `SPEC`, `SU`, `WD`, `SP`, `WI`, `WN` | Human checks become ceremonial only, leaving host-mediated substitution attacks alive. | Implicit |
| AR-51 | Peers remain available across randomized delays, recurring duress checks, and long withdrawal timelines. | `DD`, `FD`, `BD` | Honest liveness fails under normal operational conditions. | Implicit |
| AR-52 | Non-cooperation is rare enough that N-of-N remains acceptable despite known liveness cost. | `R`, `FD`, `DD` | The system regularly falls back to deterministic recovery or deadlock. | Explicit |
| AR-53 | Peers will not exploit deterministic fallback once they can predict or wait out Boomerang timing. | `FD`, `DD` | The normal regime becomes an insider bypass path rather than only a liveness valve. | Implicit |
| AR-54 | Users will maintain safe backups, heed rollover timing, and follow operational guidance consistently. | `R`, `FD`, `DD` | Security rests on a discipline level that the design itself does not enforce. | Explicit |

### H. WT And SAR Service Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Sources | If False | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AR-55 | The one active WT stays available and responsive for the entire setup or withdrawal ceremony. | `SPEC`, `R`, `SM`, `WD`, `WIP-DP` | Coordination and counter progression stop even when peers are honest. | Explicit |
| AR-56 | WT signs only correct protocol statements and forwards messages without selective censorship or bias. | `WD`, `WI`, `WN`, `SM` | A non-custodial service can force desynchronization or liveness failure. | Implicit |
| AR-57 | WT's block-height view is trustworthy enough to act as the protocol heartbeat. | `R`, `DD`, `SM`, `WD` | Freshness windows and progress rules rest on an attacker-controlled clock. | Explicit |
| AR-58 | WT redundancy, switching, and recovery can be designed later as ancillaries. | `SM`, `DD` | A single service dependency remains a critical current design weakness. | Open/WIP |
| AR-59 | SAR securely stores encrypted doxing data, identifiers, and related metadata over long periods, assuming offline cracking resistance is bounded by the user-chosen `doxing_password`. | `R`, `SM`, `SU`, `DP`, `ADR` | Off-chain safety data become a privacy or rescue failure point; weak passwords make leaked ciphertext more exposed to offline guessing. | Implicit |
| AR-60 | Each setup-bound SAR reliably detects positive duress, suppresses duplicates by the specified replay tuple, and returns acknowledgements over the exact encrypted placeholder envelope that Boomlet can trust. | `SPEC`, `SM`, `WD`, `DP`, `DCW` | Positive duress may be missed, or Boomlet may continue under false delivery assumptions. | Implicit |
| AR-61 | SAR will be able to act effectively, lawfully, and in the relevant jurisdiction once duress occurs. | `R`, `DD`, `SM` | Duress signaling may work cryptographically while failing in the real world. | Explicit |
| AR-62 | Reputation and SAR operator selection are an acceptable control for WT and SAR social trust. | `DD`, `SM` | Operational trust remains an assumption rather than a designed control. | Explicit |
| AR-63 | SAR will not become a later attacker after identity is revealed during a rescue event. | `DD`, `SM` | Duress rescue itself may create a future targeting or coercion channel. | Implicit |

### I. Network, Metadata, And Privacy

| ID | Assumption | Sources | If False | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AR-64 | Tor provides enough reachability and anti-correlation benefit for peer, WT, and SAR communication. | `R`, `SM`, `SU` | Operators can be deanonymized or the protocol can be DoS'd more easily than assumed. | Explicit |
| AR-65 | Signed onion addresses are sufficient identity binding for peer communications. | `SU`, `SP`, `SM` | Attackers can redirect peer traffic despite signed address exchange. | Implicit |
| AR-66 | Metadata leakage to WT, SAR, phone infrastructure, and network observers is acceptable for the target threat model. | `R`, `SM`, `DD`, `WIP-LD` | The system may reduce coercion timing risk while increasing targeting risk. | Explicit |
| AR-67 | Static and dynamic doxing data remain confidential until a real duress event, subject to the entropy and uniqueness of the user-chosen `doxing_password`. | `SM`, `SU`, `DP`, `WIP-LD`, `ADR` | The rescue channel itself becomes a high-value doxing database; weak or reused passwords reduce confidentiality after ciphertext exposure. | Explicit |
| AR-68 | The WIP leaked-data analysis captures the major sensitive-data inventory that matters for passive compromise. | `WIP-LD`, `SM` | Passive privacy exposure may be larger than the model assumes. | Open/WIP |
| AR-69 | Direct Bitcoin node RPC access outside Tor does not create unacceptable integrity or targeting risk. | `R`, `SM`, `SU` | Node traffic becomes another deanonymization or chain-view manipulation vector. | Implicit |

### J. Recovery, Uniqueness, And Design Evolution

| ID | Assumption | Sources | If False | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AR-70 | Setup-instance uniqueness is provided by `peer_setup_nonce`, `setup_instance_id`, ST review, and chained setup checkpoints. | `SPEC`, `DD`, `SU`, `WIP-SD`, `ADR` | No setup-identity protocol gap remains. | Resolved |
| AR-71 | Ancillary procedures can be deferred: WT switch, Boomletwo activation, Phone change, Niso change, ST change, SAR-set change, timeout handling, blame handling. | `DD`, `SM` | Realistic operations break long before the core withdrawal logic is reached. | Open/WIP |
| AR-72 | The protocol's complexity will not produce hidden failure modes beyond what later analysis can catch. | `R`, `DD`, `SM` | Emergent bugs and unsafe interactions may outpace informal reasoning. | Explicit |
| AR-73 | Dynamic simulation, threat-model completion, and implementation work will validate the timing and liveness claims. | `DD`, `SM` | The security story may not become operationally defensible. | Open/WIP |
| AR-74 | Open parameter choices for `mystery`, intervals, and tolerances can be resolved without changing the core security story. | `SM`, `DD`, `FD`, `BD` | The promised deterrence/liveness balance may depend on values that do not actually exist. | Open/WIP |
| AR-75 | Referenced prototype hardware with exposed prototyping/debug features does not invalidate the research conclusions. | `ST`, `HW-BB`, `HW-H7` | Conclusions about the trusted UI may rest on a platform that is materially weaker than assumed. | Prototype tension |
| AR-76 | Software build, update, deployment, and ordinary implementation hardening for Iso, Niso, ST, Boomlet, WT, and SAR are trustworthy enough for the design stage. | `SM`, `R`, `DD` | Malicious updates, compromised build pipelines, or ordinary service implementation flaws can bypass protocol-level guarantees even if the message design is sound. | Open/WIP |

## Formal Threat-Model Boundaries Made Explicit By The TLA+ Spec

This section records only the security-relevant boundaries in the withdrawal-focused TLA+ model. Some are trust assumptions that the security story relies on. Others are proof-scope limits that narrow what the checked TLC results prove.

These `FM-*` items supplement rather than replace the main design assumptions above. When an `FM-*` item overlaps with an `AR-*` item, read it as the exact security boundary used by the formalization.

Pure tractability choices, translation mechanics, and similar model-internal conveniences are intentionally not listed here unless they change the security meaning of the checked results.

### Formal Security Assumptions

- `FM-01`: principal identity binding is stable at the model boundary.
  The model assumes actions attributed to a peer, WT, or SAR really come from that principal.
  Why this matters: the `N-of-N` and one-honest-peer properties require named principals to be non-impersonable inside the modeled protocol.

- `FM-02`: honest approvals, commitments, and signatures are unforgeable.
  The model treats those security-relevant events as transitions that only the named peer can trigger.
  Why this matters: the checked withdrawal safety properties require protocol-authored messages to be unforgeable inside the modeled boundary.

- `FM-03`: protected cryptographic payloads stay secret unless the protocol explicitly escalates them.
  The model idealizes the relevant privacy boundary: placeholder instances are opaque, and SAR learns actionable identity only after positive duress and escalation.
  Why this matters: the checked privacy boundary is perfect-cryptography style and does not cover WT telemetry, logs, timing, or transport metadata.

- `FM-04`: freshness evidence is trustworthy at the modeled level.
  The model abstracts freshness to `seen_block`, `blockHeight`, and `FreshnessWindow`, and the core model further compresses the many source-specific timing edges into a smaller set of proof-relevant freshness classes plus acceptance-time witness maps.
  Why this matters: it assumes those values are not attacker-forged within the modeled boundary, even though deep reorgs, split chain views, and compromised block oracles are not represented directly, and it also means the core proof is not an edge-by-edge replay of every asymmetrical timing constant in the diagrams.

- `FM-05`: mystery values remain hidden and unpredictable until protocol progress reveals them.
  The model represents per-peer `mystery` values as hidden local state and enforces all-mystery gating before readiness.
  Why this matters: the design promise that participants cannot know the exact signing moment in advance relies on this hidden-state assumption; the TLA+ model captures the mechanism, not a full epistemic proof.

- `FM-07`: local trusted components faithfully capture approval and duress intent.
  The design-first model treats approval and duress as explicit protocol outcomes rather than modeling malware or UI compromise that fabricates or suppresses user intent.
  Why this matters: the SAR-escalation and deniability claims checked in the model assume the local security boundary behaves as intended.

- `FM-09`: replay resistance reduces to freshness plus single-use placeholder instances inside a sequential-session model.
  The model enforces freshness guards, single-use placeholder-instance replay memory at SAR, and reset-separated sequential sessions. It does not model concurrent sessions.
  Why this matters: the anti-replay claims do not cover concurrent multi-session deployment behavior.

- `FM-10`: fallback predicates are truthful, and fallback activation cannot be attacker-forced outside the modeled conditions.
  The formal model reduces fallback to hardware loss plus milestone gating and does not model a compromised device lying about loss or the unfinished Boomletwo activation ceremony.
  Why this matters: `FallbackOnlyAfterLossOrMilestone` is only as strong as the fidelity and non-spoofability of those triggering conditions.

### Additional Formal Security Assumptions Exposed By The Merged Withdrawal Model

These assumptions were made explicit while merging the narrow PlusCal withdrawal-core slice and the broader withdrawal-only microscope into one authoritative withdrawal model. They complement the existing `FM-*` items above; they do not supersede them.

- `FM-13`: the withdrawal proof starts after a correct setup-to-withdrawal handoff.
  The authoritative model intentionally starts post-setup and assumes ST pairing, consent-set enrollment, and the relevant key relationships are correct when the first withdrawal step occurs.
  Why this matters: the model does not itself prove that setup artifacts were generated correctly or transferred safely into withdrawal.

- `FM-14`: an authenticated withdrawal-session identifier exists across the ceremony.
  The model uses explicit `session_id` binding for initiator approval, peer approvals, commitments, pings, readiness, signing tickets, and reset-separated reuse prevention. `SPEC.md` maps that boundary to `withdrawal_id` for approval fan-out and `approved_withdrawal_id` for every post-approval replay scope.
  Why this matters: the proof relies on implementations preserving the same binding semantics between the formal `session_id` abstraction and the two concrete SPEC identifiers.

- `FM-15`: hydration and signing preserve the committed transaction intent in a way every honest peer can verify.
  The model includes an explicit non-initiator local PSBT-review gate, role-specific approval-window ordering around WT approval, and an explicit hydration step that must preserve the locked `tx_id`. `SPEC.md` adds descriptor membership, transaction semantics, reached-collection, signing-package, and final broadcast `tx_id` checks.
  Why this matters: the model's transaction-tampering guarantees assume the concrete SPEC re-check rules are implemented faithfully and that `tx_id` continuity is paired with the specified signing and broadcast validation.

- `FM-16`: SAR acknowledgements are bound to the exact placeholder instance they acknowledge.
  The model lets progress depend on settling the latest commit or ping placeholder delivery before moving forward. `SPEC.md` uses SAR signatures over the exact encrypted `duress_placeholder` envelope and Boomlet verification that the signed content matches byte-for-byte.
  Why this matters: this is a critical protocol invariant because a stale acknowledgement could otherwise satisfy progress guards while failing to prove real delivery of the active duress-bearing payload.

- `FM-17`: liveness claims rely on explicit fairness assumptions, not only on enabled transitions.
  The repository carries a separate `SpecWithFairness` and liveness cfg for narrow service-progress properties, not a full honest-path completion theorem.
  Why this matters: claims like "fresh pending SAR acknowledgements are eventually delivered" or "loss eventually triggers fallback" do not follow from safety-only `Spec`, and the repository does not prove eventual approval completion, universal reach, all-signed, or eventual broadcast.

- `FM-18`: accepted freshness evidence is preserved and attributable enough to justify later security-sensitive transitions.
  The model assumes that once a principal accepts an approval, commit, ping, pong, or SAR acknowledgement as fresh, the security-relevant fact of that acceptance is not later confused with some other event or silently forgotten in a way that would permit replay or stale evidence reuse.
  Why this matters: the security story depends on later protocol steps remaining grounded in the right accepted evidence, not only on checking freshness once.

- `FM-19`: the model assumes exactly one SAR per peer.
  The canonical withdrawal model treats SAR as single per peer, with one acknowledgement stream and one replay-memory set per peer. `SPEC.md` and ADR 0003 define one selected SAR identity per peer and setup-bound SAR routing.
  Why this matters: the checked results cover the single-SAR-per-peer contract and do not prove any quorum, redundancy, or disagreement behavior because that is out of scope.

- `FM-22`: each security-relevant placeholder instance has a unique replay-relevant identity.
  The proof assumes that a commit/ping placeholder can be distinguished from stale prior placeholders well enough for replay suppression and acknowledgement binding to be meaningful. `SPEC.md` uses fresh `CbcCmacEnvelope` IVs, `approved_withdrawal_id` context binding, and SAR replay tuples `{approved_withdrawal_id, boomlet_identity_pubkey, duress_placeholder.iv}`.
  Why this matters: if the active placeholder cannot be identified unambiguously for protocol purposes, acknowledgement binding and replay suppression claims become much weaker than the model suggests.

- `FM-23`: SAR can enforce replay suppression for the relevant placeholder identity at least on a per-peer basis.
  The proof assumes SAR can recognize that the same security-relevant placeholder has already been seen for that peer and will not accept it again as fresh delivery evidence. `SPEC.md` requires SAR replay memory keyed by `{approved_withdrawal_id, boomlet_identity_pubkey, duress_placeholder.iv}` and idempotent repeated delivery under an existing valid tuple.
  Why this matters: without reliable replay suppression at SAR, stale placeholder traffic or stale acknowledgements could satisfy the modeled delivery guards without proving delivery of the current payload.

- `FM-28`: recurring duress cadence follows the design's modulo trigger, while the PRNG itself remains abstract.
  The core and wire models fire a repeated check only when an abstract bounded draw satisfies `draw % DURESS_CHECK_INTERVAL_IN_BLOCKS = 0`. The design corpus defines that modulo rule, but not one canonical PRNG seed, persistent state, entropy source, or cross-peer independence contract.
  Why this matters: the checked results align with the documented cadence rule but do not define protocol-level source, state, or independence requirements for recurring-check draws.

### Formal Proof-Scope Limits That Narrow The Checked Security Claims

- `FM-06`: publicly observable behavior is approximated by an observable-envelope projection.
  The model uses `ObservableEnvelopeConsistentUnderPrivateDuress` to compare public message shape while hiding placeholder plaintext class and other private local state.
  Why this matters: timing leaks, payload lengths, UI behavior, transport metadata, and other side channels remain outside the security proof boundary.

- `FM-08`: WT and SAR observe only the security-relevant knowledge modeled for them.
  The model gives WT and SAR only the state that appears in the formal variables and invariants, such as opaque placeholder instances, pending acknowledgements, replay memory, and escalation status.
  Why this matters: service metadata and side channels are not represented, so privacy conclusions remain narrowly scoped.

- `FM-11`: the model does not include a full byzantine network attacker.
  Communication is abstracted into enabled protocol transitions rather than explicit message buffers with loss, duplication, censorship, or arbitrary reordering.
  Why this matters: the proven security properties are protocol-state guarantees under this abstraction, not a complete statement about hostile transport behavior.

- `FM-20`: signing and export are abstracted with a lightweight signing ticket rather than the full MuSig2 transcript.
  The model binds hydration, signed-PSBT export, and broadcast to a common `SigningTicketFor(session_id, tx_id)` witness, while omitting nonce and partial-signature details.
  Why this matters: the proof covers the authorization and transcript-binding boundary around signing, not the full cryptographic correctness of the signing subprotocol.

- `FM-21`: deterministic fallback remains a boundary event, not a fully specified ceremony.
  The model can represent hardware loss, milestone-based fallback availability, fairness-backed fallback progress, and the fact that fallback must stay separate from boomerang signing, but it does not specify how the deterministic spend is executed.
  Why this matters: the result proves separation and scoped progress claims at the boundary, not the end-to-end security of the fallback procedure itself.

- `FM-24`: successful post-broadcast reset clears volatile withdrawal state before a later withdrawal session starts.
  The model supports sequential withdrawals in one run, but only by explicit reset after successful broadcast. Concurrent sessions are outside the model.
  Why this matters: stale cross-session message acceptance is checked only for reset-separated sequential sessions; one active withdrawal at a time is assumed.

- `FM-25`: ST/Boomlet nonce transcripts are modeled explicitly, but the challenge content remains symbolic rather than a literal country-grid/UI encoding.
  The model carries explicit nonce-bound `tx_id` and duress transcript records and requires exact challenge-response agreement on `{sid, tx_id, peer, stage, seq, nonce}` before approval, commit, or recurring-check-dependent ping emission. It abstracts the displayed challenge space to a Boolean `consent_match` outcome rather than the design's literal five-column country-set interaction.
  Why this matters: replay and phase-mixup resistance at the ST boundary are represented directly, but prompt semantics below the nonce-bound transcript remain outside the checked proof surface.

- `FM-26`: end-to-end duress indistinguishability is modeled only at the message-envelope level, not at the timing/service-behavior level.
  The model checks that private duress choice does not alter the abstract public envelope shape at the modeled decision points, but it does not prove the full WT/SAR-visible behavior contract. `SPEC.md` specifies equal WT-visible acknowledgement shape, retry, timing class, and failure behavior for valid safe and duress placeholders.
  Why this matters: the TLA+ result supports only a narrower structural surrogate; the broader externally observable protocol behavior is specified outside the model.

## Practical Reading Of The Register

The assumption register shows that Boomerang's design is strongest where it narrows on-chain authorization semantics and weakest where it depends on:

- specialized trusted hardware without a complete assurance story;
- long-running coordination and timing parameters that are not fixed;
- external service providers that are non-custodial and mission-critical;
- operational discipline standing in for protocol enforcement;
- ancillary procedures to close realistic lifecycle events.

That does not make the design invalid. It does mean the maturity is best described as:

- strong research direction;
- rich protocol specification;
- incomplete security closure.

## Recommended Next Use Of This Document

This register can be used as the input to:

1. a formal trust-assumptions audit;
2. a design-roadmap prioritized by `DG-*` items;
3. a "must close before production" checklist;
4. a narrower threat model for prototype implementations of Boomlet and ST.
