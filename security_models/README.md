## Scope & assumptions
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### System summary

Boomerang is a Bitcoin cold-storage protocol designed to raise the cost of coercion by making withdrawals hardware-enforced and bounded but unpredictable in time, while embedding plausibly deniable duress signaling in the standard withdrawal path.

The design, as specified in the canonical message diagrams and design docs, has four relevant properties:

- **Taproot descriptor with two spending regimes**
  - **Boomerang regime, probabilistic and coercion-resistant:** spend becomes possible only after `milestone_block_0` and after each peer’s Boomlet reaches a secret internal threshold, `mystery`, through a coordinated ping/pong process that increments a local counter under strict freshness rules.
  - **Normal regime, deterministic fallback for liveness:** a waterfall of timelocked scripts gradually reduces the required signer threshold over future milestone block heights, for example 5-of-5 → 4-of-5 → … → 1-of-5 using **normal keys**.

- **Two-layer signing per peer in the Boomerang regime**
  - Each peer’s on-chain `boom_pubkey_i` is a **MuSig2 aggregate** of:
    - a mnemonic-backed **normal key** held and used by `Iso`, and
    - a **Boomlet-held non-exportable key share** held and used by `Boomlet`.
  - Implication: mnemonic compromise alone is insufficient to produce a Boomerang-regime signature; the corresponding Boomlet is also required.

- **Duress signaling**
  - Duress checks occur at commitment and at randomized intervals during the digging game.
  - `ST` is the trusted UI for duress challenges; `Boomlet` is the trusted evaluator.
  - A duress placeholder is embedded in protocol messages such that:
    - **no duress:** the placeholder decrypts to all-zero padding;
    - **duress:** the placeholder decrypts to `doxing_key` or equivalent unlock material, allowing `SAR` to decrypt the user’s encrypted doxing data and initiate rescue procedures.
  - `WT` forwards placeholders to `SAR`; `SAR` returns signed acknowledgements so the protocol flow stays unchanged while Boomlet still obtains assurance of receipt.

### In-scope components

Peers are joint custodians of the bitcoin involved. Per peer or operator, with five peers typical in the current design:

- **User:** the human operator.
- **Iso, offline:** key-derivation and signing environment for normal keys; interacts with Boomlet and ST.
- **Boomlet, secure element:** holds key share, enforces non-determinism, and runs duress logic.
- **Boomletwo, backup secure element:** backup of Boomlet state *excluding* `mystery`; activation procedure remains under design.
- **ST, Secure Terminal:** air-gapped, tamper-evident UI for user verification and duress challenges.
- **Niso, online:** networked coordinator per peer; handles Tor communications, talks to Bitcoin node RPC, interfaces with WT, and mediates QR flows to ST.
- **Phone:** used for SAR registration and the encrypted dynamic doxing feed.

External dependencies and services:

- **Bitcoin network / miners:** confirmation, timelocks, reorgs, fee market
- **Bitcoin node RPC endpoint(s)** used by each peer’s Niso
- **Tor network**
- **WT (Watchtower):** coordination service, liveness oracle, and relay for signed PSBTs / transactions
- **SAR (Search & Rescue):** receives encrypted doxing data, detects duress, and initiates physical response

### Out-of-scope

These items remain security-relevant but are outside the current model because the design does not yet specify them in enough detail:

- SAR’s real-world response procedures
- Detailed organizational governance
- Manufacturing processes for Boomlet / ST hardware
- Wallet UX beyond what is specified by the protocol messages

### Primary assets

**Custody / value assets**
- **Bitcoin funds** locked by the Boomerang Taproot output
- **Transaction authorization correctness:** PSBT contents, destination, amounts, fees

**Key material & cryptographic assets**
- `mnemonic`, `passphrase`, and derived **normal private keys**
- Boomlet-held `boom_musig2_privkey_share`, non-exportable
- Boomlet identity keypair for signing and encryption
- ST identity keypair for the Boomlet↔ST secure channel
- Tor onion-service secret keys for peer Niso addresses
- WT and SAR long-term signing / encryption keys

**Duress & safety assets**
- `duress_consent_set`
- `doxing_password` / `doxing_key` and derived `doxing_data_identifier`
- **Static doxing data** and **dynamic doxing feed**

**Protocol state assets**
- Per-Boomlet `mystery` and `counter`
- `boomerang_params` and `boomerang_descriptor`
- Protocol transcripts
- Milestone schedule, `milestone_block_collection`

### Security objectives

**Funds protection**
- Prevent unauthorized spending in both regimes.
- Prevent silent transaction tampering.
- Ensure recoverability in the normal regime under loss scenarios, while managing the associated risk.

**Coercion resistance**
- Under coercion, reduce attacker confidence in *time to cash-out*.
- Provide unavoidable, plausibly deniable duress signaling with minimal observable divergence.
- Preserve a reaction window for SAR response and deterrence.

**Privacy & safety**
- Minimize metadata that could enable targeting of key holders.
- Protect doxing data and duress signals from unauthorized disclosure.
- Resist correlation attacks that deanonymize peers, schedules, or duress events.

**Integrity & liveness**
- Prevent protocol-state desynchronization and replay.
- Ensure withdrawal completes when honest peers cooperate and dependencies are available.
- Ensure failures degrade safely, preferably fail-closed in the Boomerang regime.

### High-impact assumptions

Assumptions that materially affect risk ratings.

- **Boomlet secure-element security holds**
- **ST integrity holds**
- **Cryptography holds for the message set and signing flows**
- **Software build, update, and deployment paths for Iso, Niso, ST, Boomlet, WT, and SAR are trustworthy enough**
- **At least one honest peer exists**
- **Bitcoin timelocks behave as expected**
- **`most_work_bitcoin_block_height` obtained by Niso and WT is trustworthy enough to drive milestone gating, freshness, and counter advancement**
- **Local freshness checks, `tx_id`, and signed transcripts are sufficient to keep each setup instance and withdrawal ceremony correctly bound**
- **`tx_id` continuity is sufficient to preserve operator intent across PSBT hydration and final signing**
- **SAR acknowledgements are bound to the exact duress-placeholder instance and do not create a publicly distinguishable safe branch or duress branch**
- **Only one of Boomlet and Boomletwo is ever active for a given peer identity**
- **WT and SAR remain available**
- **Peers have a secure out-of-band channel**

### Key unknowns blocking production readiness

Items that block production-readiness claims.

- Exact values and selection policy for the non-determinism and duress-check parameters
- Reorg-handling policy
- WT / SAR redundancy model
- Cryptographic details: AEAD mode, KDF, transcript binding, serialization
- Boomletwo activation / recovery protocol
- Software supply chain and update mechanisms
- Monitoring, alerting, and incident-response workflows

### Open design boundaries

Current-stage security boundaries that remain unresolved.

| Boundary | Why it matters now |
| --- | --- |
| **Chain view and reorg policy** | Milestone gating, freshness, and counter advancement depend on chain view, but reorg and divergent-node policy is not yet fixed. |
| **Setup / withdrawal binding** | Binding still relies on local freshness checks, `tx_id`, and signed context rather than one authenticated setup or withdrawal session identifier. |
| **Hydrated PSBT authorization contract** | Niso hydrates the PSBT after the digging game and Boomlet checks `tx_id` continuity, but allowed mutations and re-verification duties are not fixed. |
| **Boomlet and Boomletwo activation semantics** | Backup export and import exist, but activation, deactivation, and the one-active-device invariant are not yet fixed. |
| **Duress-placeholder lifecycle** | Safety still depends on placeholder-instance binding, SAR replay memory, signed acknowledgements, and timing discipline that does not distinguish safe from duress. |
| **Operational transitions** | Device movement, replacement, and recovery for Phone, Niso, ST, WT selection, and SAR-set changes remain only partly specified. |
| **Honest-path liveness / fairness policy** | Completion still depends on peer availability, timeout policy, blame handling, and scheduler or service fairness that the corpus does not yet define. |
| **Parameter selection and timing policy** | Security still depends on workable choices for milestones, mystery range, duress cadence, and freshness tolerances. |
| **Cryptographic profile and canonical transcript encoding** | AEAD and KDF choices, authoritative serializations, transcript objects, and message-binding rules are not yet fixed. |
| **Trusted-hardware assurance boundary** | Boomlet and ST are treated as trusted boundaries, but attestation, audit, hardening profile, and production assurance remain incomplete. |
| **Software supply chain and service implementation security** | Build pipelines, update paths, deployment hardening, patching discipline, and ordinary implementation hardening are not yet fixed. |
| **WT / SAR service governance and accountability** | WT and SAR behavior, failover, single-SAR semantics, misuse resistance, and jurisdictional fit are not yet fully specified. |
| **Privacy and network exposure policy** | Tor, RPC, WT, SAR, and doxing-data flows still lack a final minimization policy for metadata leakage, correlation, and acceptable exposure. |

Boomlet and ST are treated as trusted devices. The cited prototype materials do not establish production-grade tamper resistance, secure boot, or hardened lifecycle controls.

## Trust boundaries + Trust Boundary Diagram
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Boomerang depends on hard separation between offline and online systems, between human intent and host-mediated I/O, and between local components and external coordination services. The boundaries below are used consistently across the DFD, threat catalog, and risk register.

**Interpretation**

- Boomerang’s strongest intended security properties depend on TB-BOOMLET and TB-ST holding.
- Boomerang’s strongest intended availability properties depend on TB-WT and TB-RPC behaving correctly, or having redundancy and failover.
- Coercion resistance is fundamentally a **human + physical** problem; the technical protocol mainly shapes incentives and time.

## Human & Physical Risk
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Boomerang is designed for a threat environment in which physical coercion is credible. Human operators, facilities, travel patterns, and operational discipline are therefore first-class attack surfaces.

### Human/physical threat scenarios

| Scenario                                                            | Trust boundaries involved          | Primary assets at risk                   | What can go wrong                                                                                    | Candidate mitigations, design and operations                                                                                                 |

| **Process non-compliance, such as missed rollover or skipped checks** | TB-PHYS-PEER, TB-OOB             | Funds, coercion resistance               | Users miss rollover windows or skip required checks, allowing the protocol to drift into weaker deterministic stages | Mandatory rollover schedule; automated reminders; rehearsals; documented exception handling and sign-off |
| **Operator error, including wrong milestones, outputs, or network** | TB-PHYS-PEER, TB-ISO, TB-ST        | Funds, liveness                          | Setup produces the wrong descriptor or milestones; withdrawal signs the wrong transaction or wrong network | Strict checklists; independent operator-side transaction review on dedicated hardware; testnet rehearsals; sanity checks and invariants in Iso |

| **Power interruption during signing or backup procedures**          | TB-PHYS-PEER, TB-BOOMLET, TB-ISO   | Signing state, liveness                  | Interrupted sessions cause partial state, nonce reuse, or lost progress                              | Atomic signing sessions; anti-rollback; UPS; recovery paths |
| **Jurisdictional or legal coercion of SAR or operators**            | TB-JURIS, TB-SAR                   | PII, user safety, service availability   | SAR forced to reveal data, delay action, or refuse service; operator compelled disclosure            | Minimize PII; legal counsel; documented policies; transparency reports |

### Duress mechanism assumptions

The duress mechanism assumes two things:
- the attacker cannot observe consent-set entry without detection by the user; and
- ST does not leak consent-set material.

- The attacker cannot observe both the ST display and the user's selection behavior well enough to learn the consent set.
- ST does not leak consent-set material.
- Users can reproduce the consent set reliably under stress, fatigue, or coercion.

These assumptions are operationally fragile. Cameras, multiple attackers, and controlled environments directly weaken them. Shielding, private environments, and operator drills remain necessary.

Primary coercion campaign: [Tree 0](#tree-0-primary-attacker-campaign-steal-funds-under-coercion-or-force-deterministic-fallback).

### Operational hardening checklist

**People**
- Run regular coercion, recovery, and rollover drills.
- Minimize who knows peer identities and custody roles.

**Facilities**
- Use secure, access-controlled environments for setup, backup, and withdrawal ceremonies.
- Maintain tamper-evident seals and inspection logs for ST, Boomlet, and Boomletwo.
- Keep Boomlet, Boomletwo, and mnemonic backups in geographically separated storage.

**Travel**
- Avoid predictable patterns and role disclosure.
- Use secure transport and avoid carrying all critical devices or backups together.

**Incident response**
- Predefine device-loss, coercion-suspected, and missed-rollover playbooks.
- Maintain a rehearsed rollover or fund-movement plan before deterministic stages.

### Data classification

The classification below combines custody impact, safety impact, and privacy sensitivity rather than using a pure confidentiality label.

| Data                                           | Classification                    | Notes                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mnemonic, passphrase, normal private keys      | **Critical secret**               | Compromise enables deterministic theft later                              |
| Boomlet key shares + identity private key      | **Critical secret**               | Compromise breaks Boomerang regime, privacy, and duress                   |
| Duress consent set                             | **Critical secret**               | If learned, a coercer can bypass the duress mechanism                     |
| Doxing data (static + dynamic)                 | **Critical safety-sensitive PII** | Compromise enables targeting and harm                                     |
| Doxing key / identifier                        | **Critical secret / metadata**    | Password-derived; compromise weakens rescue privacy and duress safety     |
| Boomerang descriptor, peer IDs                 | **Sensitive configuration**       | Key substitution is catastrophic                                          |
| Protocol transcripts                           | **Sensitive metadata**            | Linkability and timing can enable targeting                               |
| Signed PSBTs / transaction                     | **Public after broadcast**        | Before broadcast, still sensitive                                         |

### Protocol parameter surface

The design defines at least the following parameter families:

- Milestone and fallback schedule:
  - `milestone_block_0`
  - later `milestone_block_*` values that control deterministic fallback stages

- Mystery and digging-game range:
  - per-peer `mystery`
  - `MIN_TRIES_FOR_DIGGING_GAME_IN_BLOCKS`
  - `MAX_TRIES_FOR_DIGGING_GAME_IN_BLOCKS`

- Non-determinism window:
  - the effective interaction between `mystery`, digging-game bounds, and milestone spacing

- Duress check cadence:
  - `DURESS_CHECK_INTERVAL_IN_BLOCKS`
  - recurring-duress trigger behavior and any PRNG-state assumptions that drive it

- Freshness and tolerance windows:
  - `TOLERANCE_IN_BLOCKS_FROM_TX_APPROVAL_BY_INITIATOR_PEER_TO_TX_APPROVAL_BY_WT`
  - `TOLERANCE_IN_BLOCKS_FROM_CREATING_PING_TO_RECEIVING_ALL_PINGS_BY_WT_AND_HAVING_SAR_RESPONSE_BACK_TO_WT`
  - `REQUIRED_MINIMUM_DISTANCE_IN_BLOCKS_BETWEEN_PING_AND_PONG`
  - …and several more `TOLERANCE_*` / `REQUIRED_MINIMUM_DISTANCE_*` constraints

Implication: these parameters define the adversary’s feasible delay and replay windows and materially affect coercion cost, false positives, and liveness. Parameter selection belongs under explicit security governance, with test coverage and operational monitoring.

### Current protocol-binding boundaries

- Setup currently binds state through local freshness checks, peer and service identity checks, and signed transcripts. Withdrawal adds committed `tx_id`, later approvals, and signing-state continuity. The current design still does not define one authenticated setup-instance identifier or one authenticated withdrawal-session identifier spanning the full ceremony.
- After the digging game, Niso hydrates the PSBT and Boomlet checks that the derived `tx_id` still matches the committed transaction. The exact hydration contract, including allowed mutations, operator-side re-verification duties, and failure handling, remains a boundary.
- Duress safety depends on the exact placeholder instance, SAR replay memory, and signed acknowledgement reaching the originating Boomlet without a publicly distinguishable safe branch or duress branch.

## Systematic attack identification
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The checklist below is intended for design review, implementation review, tabletop exercises, and red-team planning. It spans cyber, cryptographic, supply-chain, insider, and physical / coercion attack classes and preserves traceability to both the STRIDE catalog and the risk register.

- Each row maps to **Threat IDs** (STRIDE catalog) and **Risk IDs** (risk register).
- Use this checklist during design reviews, implementation reviews, tabletop exercises, and red-team planning.
- The main threat tables in this document apply to the current canonical design only. Future architecture concerns belong in the roadmap or in the open design boundaries above, not in the threat inventory.

## Risk register
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The register below follows the NIST SP 800-30r1 structure: threat event, vulnerability or predisposing condition, likelihood, impact, and response. Each risk is mapped to threat IDs and CCSS v9 controls.

### Scoring method

- **Likelihood (1–5):** Rare → Almost certain
- **Impact (1–5):** Negligible → Catastrophic
- **Risk score:** `Likelihood × Impact`
  - 1–5 Low, 6–10 Medium, 11–15 High, 16–25 Critical

Scoring baseline for this revision: canonical design corpus as of April 11, 2026.

Scores below are calibrated to the design and the controls or assumptions explicitly present in the canonical corpus. Roadmap mitigations do not reduce current-stage scores.

`Status` indicates whether the present posture depends mainly on controls, assumptions, or unresolved design gaps.

## Attack / attack-defense trees
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The following trees capture the highest-risk attacker goals and the current controls or open dependencies that shape them.

Green nodes are current controls. Yellow nodes are assumptions or unresolved boundaries.

### Tree 0: Primary attacker campaign: steal funds under coercion or force deterministic fallback

Tree 0 is the top-level attacker campaign for Boomerang. Trees 1-5 decompose the supporting technical paths and enabling conditions.

### Mitigation roadmap

| Horizon | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                           | Addresses Risks     | Verification                                                                                    | Success criteria                                                                                | Resolution |
| :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- |
| Now     | Specify and implement cryptographic primitives with AEAD and HKDF domain separation; publish serialization formats and test vectors.                                   | R-14,R-10,R-25      | Independent cryptography review; test vectors across implementations; fuzzing of serialization. | No unauthenticated ciphertext malleability; deterministic nonce scheme; all interop tests pass. |  |
| Now     | Replace doxing_key derivation with Argon2id or scrypt and a per-user random salt; update SAR protocol to avoid stable identifiers; enforce password entropy.           | R-07,R-06           | Crypto review; simulated breach with offline cracking evaluation; privacy impact assessment.    | Offline cracking cost exceeds policy threshold; no stable cross-SAR identifier.                 |  |
| Now     | Preserve a simple ST trust boundary: require independent PSBT verification on dedicated operator hardware and keep ST focused on tx_id continuity and duress checks. | R-08,R-15           | UX review; adversarial test cases; red-team exercises around tx_id continuity.                  | Tampered PSBT detected by the operator verification path and continuity checks in tests.        |  |
| Now     | Harden Niso as a dedicated appliance: minimal OS, disk encryption, MAC, strict update process, no general browsing, and dedicated peripherals.                      | R-08,R-20,R-11      | Hardening benchmark; penetration test; malware simulation.                                      | No privilege escalation in standard tests; hardening baseline met on the dedicated build.       |  |
| Now     | Define and rehearse incident response: suspected coercion, lost or stolen Boomlet or ST, WT outage, SAR outage, and approaching milestones.                         | R-15,R-03,R-22,R-13 | Tabletop exercises; runbook reviews; drill results.                                             | Operators can execute response within defined time; roles and contacts are clear.               |  |
| Now     | Formalize operational rollover policy and monitoring and alerts for milestone schedule; automated reminders and dashboards.                                          | R-15,R-03,R-04      | Operational audit; testnet rollover drill; monitoring tests.                                    | No funds remain in low-threshold deterministic stage beyond policy window.                      |  |
| Next    | Multi-WT architecture with provider and jurisdiction diversity, transparency logs, and WT key management with HSM.                                                  | R-05,R-13,R-16      | Failover tests; WT security audit; chaos testing.                                               | Withdrawal completes under single-WT failure; WT telemetry follows the approved minimization policy. |  |
| Next    | Redundant SAR design where policy permits, with audited access, emergency alternative channels, and verification playbooks for uncertain duress signals.             | R-06,R-22,R-21      | Duress end-to-end drills; privacy audit; SLA testing; false-positive exercises.                 | Duress delivery success rate meets target; false positives are verified and handled safely.     |  |
| Next    | Hardware security evaluation of Boomlet and ST covering side channels, fault injection, and supply chain; improve tamper evidence.                                  | R-01,R-02,R-19      | Independent lab reports; teardown reviews; provenance controls.                                 | No key extraction in evaluation threat model; tamper attempts detected.                         |  |
| Next    | Formalize Boomletwo activation and recovery protocol, ensuring the one-active-device invariant and preventing mystery cloning.                                      | R-18,R-03           | Design review; adversarial tests; formal invariants.                                            | Backup cannot reduce unpredictability; recovery works without weakening security.               |  |
| Later   | Formal verification and simulation of digging-game state machine under adversarial delays, reorgs, and equivocation; publish proofs and claims.                    | R-25,R-09,R-10      | TLA+/Ivy model; simulation harness; third-party review.                                         | Safety and liveness properties are proven under stated assumptions.                             |  |
| Later   | Advanced privacy protections: traffic padding, constant-size messaging, payment unlinkability, improved anonymity set management.                                    | R-16,R-23,R-20      | Traffic analysis tests; chain analysis; privacy audit.                                          | Correlation risk reduced below defined threshold.                                               |  |

Threats are mapped to STRIDE categories, relevant surfaces, and risk IDs. The table includes protocol, hardware, operational, and environmental threats when they materially affect the same security properties.

**ID conventions**

- `T-SPOOF-*` → Spoofing / identity binding failures
- `T-TAMP-*` → Tampering / integrity failures
- `T-REP-*` → Repudiation / dispute & audit failures
- `T-INFO-*` / `T-PRIV-*` → Information disclosure / privacy failures
- `T-DOS-*` → Denial of service / liveness failures
- `T-EOP-*` → Elevation of privilege / unauthorized capability escalation
- `T-CRYPTO-*`, `T-BTC-*`, `T-SE-*`, `T-DURESS-*`, etc. → domain-specific threats mapped to STRIDE categories as relevant

| T-WT-05 | S/T | WT signing key management | Compromise of WT signing keys allows forged receipts, acknowledgements, or transcript material that peers may trust. | Protocol integrity loss; false assurances; service abuse. | Key pinning; rotation and revocation procedures; audited key handling; offline or hardware-backed key protection where feasible. | R-05 |
### STRIDE coverage notes

- **Spoofing** risks are highest during **setup**, especially peer, WT, and SAR identity binding, and during any flow where `Niso` mediates content over QR.
- **Tampering** risks concentrate around PSBT integrity, message framing and canonicalization, and encryption mode correctness, especially AEAD versus non-AEAD handling.
- **Repudiation** matters for governance and incident response: without immutable signed transcripts, disputes become likely.
- **Information disclosure** is dominated by *metadata*, including Tor, WT logs, and payments, and by *PII*, especially doxing data, plus the critical secret `duress_consent_set`.
- **DoS** is fundamental: WT, SAR, and Tor outages, peer non-cooperation, fee spikes, and parser/resource exhaustion can freeze withdrawals and in duress scenarios undermine safety.
- **Elevation of privilege** primarily concerns **secure element and ST compromise**, and state-machine bugs that allow host-driven abuse.

Boomerang is not a conventional web application, but WT, SAR, the phone app, and networked Niso components still inherit ordinary application-security failure modes. The table below maps OWASP-style practices to those components and identifies the main gaps.

## Appendix C: CCSS mapping & roadmap
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Target CCSS level recommendation

Given the threat environment — high-value custody, coercion risk, and external-service dependencies — Boomerang should be evaluated against **CCSS Level III** targets for:
- key generation and entropy controls
- key storage, backup, and access controls
- service provider management and external dependency controls
- operational governance and risk management
- operator environment, device custody, and secure-use controls
- auditing, logging, and monitoring
- software build, release, and update integrity
- compromise documentation and response
- data retention, sanitization, and privacy-preserving handling

### Main CCSS-driven gaps

- This list is limited to CCSS controls that correspond to documented current-stage design gaps or unresolved protocol and architecture boundaries.
- **Governance & risk management**: `2.03.1`, `2.03.2`
- **Service provider management for WT and SAR**: `2.03.3`
- **Key redundancy, backup existence, and recovery activation semantics**: `1.02.2`, `1.03.2`
- **Key compromise response and incident handling**: `2.04.1`, `2.04.2`
- **Audit logging, monitoring, and evidence retention**: `2.02.*`
- **Transaction verification before key use**: `1.05.8`
- **Data sanitization and residual-secret handling**: `1.06.*`
- **Cryptographic implementation detail and verification**: `1.01.2`, `1.01.3`, `1.01.4`, `1.05.10`, `2.01.1`
- **Trusted environment and device-isolation expectations**: `1.05.2`
- **Software build, update, and release integrity**: `2.01.1`, `2.03.3`

### Condensed now / next / later roadmap

#### Now (security-critical prerequisites)
- **Specify cryptography precisely** (AEAD modes, KDF/HKDF contexts, nonce handling, transcript binding, canonical encoding, and signing-side DRBG discipline). `CCSS: 1.01.2, 1.01.3, 1.05.10, 2.01.1 | Threat/Risk: T-CRYPTO-01, T-CRYPTO-02, T-CRYPTO-05 / R-01, R-10, R-14`
- **Fix doxing key derivation and SAR privacy posture** (Argon2id/scrypt + per-user salt; minimization; retention). `CCSS: 1.03.1, 2.03.3, 2.03.2 | Threat/Risk: T-CRYPTO-03, T-INFO-01 / R-07, R-06`
- **Preserve spend verification before key use** by keeping ST focused on `tx_id` continuity and duress checks while requiring independent verification of destinations and amounts on dedicated operator hardware before signing. `CCSS: 1.05.8 | Threat/Risk: T-TAMP-01 / R-08, R-15`
- **Define and rehearse key compromise policies** (lost Boomlet, suspected coercion, SAR/WT outage). `CCSS: 2.04.1, 2.04.2 | Threat/Risk: T-PHYS-01, T-DOS-01, T-DOS-02, T-OPS-03 / R-03, R-05, R-13, R-15, R-22`

#### Next (scale and resilience)
- **WT/SAR redundancy with provider diversity** (multi-jurisdiction, failover, transparency). `CCSS: 2.03.3, 2.02.* | Threat/Risk: T-DOS-01, T-INFO-03 / R-05, R-13, R-16`
- **Harden supply chain** (signed builds, reproducible artifacts, SBOM, secure provisioning). `CCSS: 2.01.1, 2.03.3 | Threat/Risk: T-UPDATE-01 / R-24`
- **Formalize operational environment requirements** (trusted environment boundaries, device custody, and inspections). `CCSS: 1.05.2 | Threat/Risk: T-PHYS-02, T-PHYS-04 / R-19, R-02`

#### Later (high assurance)
- **Formal verification and simulation** of the digging game/state machine under adversarial delays and reorgs. `CCSS: 2.01.1, 2.03.2 | Threat/Risk: T-PROTO-01, T-FRESH-01, T-TAMP-07 / R-25`
- **Independent hardware security evaluation** of Boomlet and ST (side-channel/fault injection). `CCSS: 1.05.2, 2.01.1 | Threat/Risk: T-SE-03, T-SE-04 / R-01`

## Appendix D: Detailed design gaps
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Protocol, timing, and transaction semantics

| Gap ID | Design gap | Why it matters now | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DG-01 | No explicit reorg and block-oracle policy | The protocol heavily relies on `most_work_bitcoin_block_height`, but the corpus does not yet define reorg handling, node trust boundaries, or what to do on divergent chain views. | Critical |
| DG-02 | No parameter-selection framework for milestones, mystery range, and freshness windows | The security story depends on the right timing constants existing, but the design does not yet specify how to choose or validate them. | Critical |
| DG-03 | Forced determinism is still controlled mostly by user discipline and peer behavior | The design explicitly acknowledges late start, device loss, and non-cooperation as collapse paths, but the mitigation is still mainly "roll over in time and operate carefully." | Critical |
| DG-05 | Setup uniqueness and anti-replay are incomplete | Some setup messages are not yet unique to a specific setup instance, which means replay resistance is not closed end-to-end. | High |
| DG-06 | The cryptographic profile is under-specified | The docs name primitives and flows, but not the final AEAD mode, KDF choices, transcript binding rules, canonical encodings, or test vectors needed for interoperable security. | Critical |
| DG-17 | Several safety properties are still context-derived rather than explicitly bound per message | The current message set still recovers some safety properties indirectly through surrounding context or later checks rather than by direct authoritative binding. | High |
| DG-21 | Withdrawal-session binding is still implicit rather than protocol-canonical | The design relies on approvals, commitments, pings, and signing readiness all belonging to one withdrawal attempt, but it does not yet define one authenticated session identifier or transcript bundle spanning the whole ceremony. | Critical |
| DG-22 | The transaction-authorization contract between early approval and final signing is under-specified | The withdrawal flow requires the hydrated PSBT to preserve the committed `tx_id`, but it does not yet specify the exact allowed mutations, satisfiability checks, authoritative hydrator behavior, independent operator-side verification duties, or rejection rules when hydration changes more than expected. | High |
| DG-23 | SAR acknowledgement semantics are still under-specified at the protocol-document level | The current model binds acknowledgements to exact placeholder instances and replay memory, but the design docs still do not give one canonical transcript object or operational failure policy for SAR acknowledgement delivery. | High |
| DG-24 | Honest-path liveness still depends on unstated fairness and timeout policy | The protocol narrative says withdrawal should complete when parties cooperate, but the docs still do not define the scheduler, retry, timeout, or service-progress assumptions precisely enough to support unqualified liveness claims. | High |
| DG-25 | Freshness evidence retention and auditability are not yet protocol-canonical | Later steps depend on accepted freshness evidence still being attributable and reviewable, but the design docs do not yet define how such evidence is serialized, retained, or audited when chain height keeps moving. | High |
| DG-28 | Mid-ceremony interaction between boomerang progress and fallback opening is under-specified | The current design does not define one canonical operator procedure for what honest peers should do when boomerang progress and deterministic fallback availability overlap. | High |
| DG-29 | Placeholder-instance lifecycle is not yet protocol-canonical | The current design depends on unique opaque placeholder instances and replay memory, but still describes that mostly through narrative IV language rather than one canonical transcript or data structure. | High |
| DG-30 | Post-withdrawal cleanup and reset semantics are still only partly specified in the design corpus | The design needs one canonical cross-component cleanup contract and failure policy if cleanup is interrupted after signing or broadcast. | High |
| DG-31 | ST/Boomlet transcript encoding is still under-specified below the nonce-bound transcript level | The design does not yet define one canonical serialized transcript object, one canonical ST prompt encoding, or one canonical country-grid representation that implementations must share. | High |
| DG-32 | End-to-end duress indistinguishability still lacks a timing and error-discipline contract | The design promises no observable message change and no duration change under duress, but does not yet define service latency, retries, timing equalization, or distinguishable operational side effects at WT and SAR. | Critical |
| DG-33 | Recurring-duress PRNG source and state are still not protocol-canonical | The repeated duress-check trigger rule is described, but the design still does not say what is being sampled, whether PRNG state is persistent, how draws are audited, or whether peers must have independent PRNG streams. | High |

### Boomlet, ST, and endpoint platform assurance

| Gap ID | Design gap | Why it matters now | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DG-04 | Boomletwo activation and anti-clone semantics are unspecified | Backup existence is described, but the safe way to deactivate Boomlet and activate Boomletwo without creating duplicate authority is not yet designed. | Critical |
| DG-07 | Boomlet assurance is assumed, not demonstrated | The central trust anchor is expected to resist extraction, side channels, bias, cloning, and endurance failures, but there is no attestation, audit, or hardware assurance story in this repo. | Critical |
| DG-08 | The ST trust model is stronger than the current prototype evidence | The ST is treated like a single-purpose trusted appliance, while the referenced Portenta and breakout materials emphasize prototyping, boot modes, debug access, exposed signals, and flexible I/O. | Critical |
| DG-09 | Prototype attack surface is not converted into a hardened ST build profile | The design does not yet define which interfaces are removed, fused off, sealed, or monitored in the ST build despite the prototype exposing multiple attack-friendly interfaces. | High |
| DG-10 | Endpoint transition and replacement procedures are missing | The design requires moving hardware between hosts and anticipates replacing Phone, Niso, and ST, but those procedures are still ancillary only and not defined. | High |

### Services, operators, and recovery

| Gap ID | Design gap | Why it matters now | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DG-34 | Software supply chain and service implementation security remain under-specified | The threat model already treats update/build compromise and WT/SAR service compromise as first-class risks, but the design still lacks a final trust model for build provenance, update authorization, deployment hardening, patching discipline, and secure service operation. | High |
| DG-11 | Dynamic doxing data integrity is largely delegated to the phone and SAR operations | Rescue quality depends on phone-sourced data staying correct and current, but the current design gives little direct protection against phone compromise or feed stoppage. | High |
| DG-12 | WT is a critical coordination dependency without a finalized failover or accountability model | WT is non-custodial but still central to liveness, freshness, routing, and metadata exposure, and switching or redundancy procedures remain deferred. | Critical |
| DG-13 | SAR governance, abuse resistance, and jurisdiction handling remain operational assumptions | The design depends on reputation, SAR operator choice, and jurisdictional fit, but does not yet specify controls against SAR misuse, compulsion, or ineffective response. | Critical |
| DG-14 | Peer governance is under-specified for blame, timeout, and non-cooperation | N-of-N is intentional, but the design still lacks final procedures for peer delay, blame, expulsion, recovery from silence, or coordination breakdown. | High |
| DG-15 | Human availability is not yet reconciled with random duress checks and freshness limits | The design wants unpredictable checks, but also recognizes that users sleep, travel, live in different time zones, and can be delayed under ordinary conditions. | High |
| DG-19 | The protocol is not yet backed by formal or simulation-based validation of timing behavior | The design itself notes that complexity and dynamic behavior may produce unexpected delays and failures, but the validating simulations are still future work. | High |
| DG-20 | Too many security-critical properties are still expressed as future ancillaries or operator discipline | The current design can explain how the happy path works, but many real-world safety properties still live outside the protocol core. | High |
| DG-26 | The single-SAR-per-peer contract is not yet stated canonically in the design corpus | The current model treats SAR as exactly one SAR per peer, but the design corpus still needs to say that explicitly and remove residual ambiguous wording. | High |

### Privacy and network exposure

| Gap ID | Design gap | Why it matters now | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DG-16 | Privacy leakage is inventoried but not yet turned into a minimization strategy | The current leakage analysis shows a large sensitive-data surface area, but the design does not yet consolidate which disclosures are acceptable, avoidable, or must be redesigned. | High |
| DG-18 | The network trust model is incomplete | Tor is assumed for privacy and availability, direct RPC is assumed safe enough, and signed onion addresses are assumed sufficient, but correlation, censorship, and routing edge cases are not fully modeled. | Medium |
