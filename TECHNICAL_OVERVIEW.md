**TL;DR:** Boomerang is a coercion-aware Bitcoin cold-storage protocol that enforces a **bounded but unpredictable withdrawal time** in hardware and embeds **plausibly deniable duress signaling** into the normal withdrawal flow — **without changing Bitcoin consensus**.

Boomerang is a Bitcoin cold-storage protocol designed to protect not only against digital compromise, but also against **real-world coercion**. Conventional custody systems are largely **deterministic**: attackers can learn who must sign, what steps must occur, and approximately how long it will take. Under physical coercion, that predictability becomes the attacker’s advantage.

Boomerang explores a different primitive:
> **Hardware-enforced, bounded but unpredictable withdrawal time** + **plausibly deniable duress signaling** embedded in normal protocol flow — **without changing Bitcoin consensus**.

## Motivation

Bitcoin cryptography secures **keys**. It does not secure **people**.

In high-value custody settings (enterprise treasuries, sovereign individuals, multi-operator governance), a realistic adversary is not just a remote attacker. It may be a coercive attacker who:

- identifies key holders,
- forces them to participate,
- and relies on predictable procedures and timelines.

Most cold storage designs are deterministic under coercion. Boomerang is an attempt to **reduce the attacker’s confidence in time** and to create a **reaction window** for intervention — while still guaranteeing eventual recoverability.

----

## Core Idea

Funds are locked in a Taproot output with **two spending regimes**:

```
        Unspendable key path
                 |
    ---------------------------------
    |                               |
Boomerang regime                Normal regime
(non-deterministic)         (deterministic fallback)

```

### 1) Boomerang regime (primary)
- Requires **N-of-N MuSig2 aggregated keys**.
- Each aggregated key includes:
  - a recoverable **normal key** (mnemonic-backed), and
  - a hardware key share inside a secure element (**Boomlet**) that is not
    available to the host and is exportable only to an authorized Boomletwo
    through the authenticated backup envelope.
- Withdrawals require a coordinated protocol and only become signable after a secret, per-device threshold (“**mystery**”) is reached.
- **No participant (including the victim) can know in advance when signing becomes possible.**

### 2) Normal regime (fallback)
- Activated after milestone block heights.
- Provides deterministic, time-locked scripts that gradually reduce the required signer threshold.
- Ensures **eventual liveness** even if hardware is lost or the Boomerang regime cannot complete.

Boomerang introduces uncertainty; the normal regime guarantees recoverability.

----

## What Boomerang Is And Is Not

### Boomerang is:
- A **research protocol** for coercion-aware custody.
- A design that treats **time determinism as an attack surface**.
- A Taproot/MuSig2/timelock construction that **requires no consensus changes**.

### Boomerang is not:
- “Duress-proof Bitcoin.”
- A consumer wallet.
- A replacement for simple multisig cold storage.
- Production ready.

----

## Architecture Overview

Boomerang is not a single device. It is a distributed custody protocol involving:

- multiple peer operators,
- dedicated hardware,
- an online coordination service,
- and a rescue service that only learns identity upon duress.

### Actors

Per peer:

- **Boomlet**: Secure element (JavaCard-class) that:
  - holds a MuSig2 key share,
  - enforces the withdrawal non-determinism (“mystery” threshold),
  - executes duress logic.
- **Boomletwo**: Backup smartcard (inactive until activation; activation procedure is an ancillary still under design).
- **Iso**: Offline environment for:
  - key derivation / installation,
  - sensitive operations,
  - final MuSig2 signing with Boomlet.
- **Niso**: Online environment for:
  - Tor communications with peers and Watchtower,
  - direct Bitcoin node RPC access,
  - mediating the withdrawal protocol.
- **ST (Secure Terminal)**: Air-gapped human interface for:
  - transaction approvals,
  - duress input,
  - minimizing trust in online components.
- **Phone**: Used to register with SAR and stream encrypted dynamic data.

External:

- **Bitcoin Network**
- **Bitcoin Node (RPC endpoint)**: used by each peer’s Niso (direct, not “restricted to Tor”).
- **Tor Network**: used for peer↔peer and peer↔WT communication.
- **WT (Watchtower)**: coordination + liveness service.
- **SAR (Search & Rescue)**: receives duress placeholders; decrypts identity only on duress.

----

## System Topology

This diagram reflects the setup and withdrawal design constraints:

- **Niso has direct RPC access to a Bitcoin node** for block height and transaction context.
- **Tor is used for peer and Watchtower communications**, not as a requirement for Bitcoin node access.
- **ST is air-gapped**: it communicates via QR through **Iso or Niso** (screen/camera relay), depending on phase.
- **Phone talks directly to SAR** for registration and dynamic doxing feed.
- **WT forwards duress placeholders to SAR** during withdrawal.

## How Withdrawal Works

Withdrawal is a multi-phase ceremony coordinated through WT, with repeated human verification and duress opportunities. The normative state machine and message rules are in [`spec/SPEC.md`](spec/SPEC.md); the PlantUML diagrams are explanatory views.

### Conceptual Withdrawal Flow

This diagram is intentionally simplified to communicate the core structure without overwhelming detail:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Initiator
    participant Peers
    participant WT
    participant SAR

    Initiator->>WT: Submit PSBT approval
    WT->>Peers: Distribute PSBT
    Peers->>WT: Approvals

    Note over Initiator,Peers: Commitment + Duress Check
    Peers->>WT: Commit + Duress Placeholder
    WT->>SAR: Forward Placeholder
    SAR-->>WT: Signed Response

    Note over Initiator,Peers: Non-deterministic Digging Game
    loop Until all mystery thresholds reached
        Peers->>WT: Ping (with random duress checks)
        WT->>SAR: Forward placeholder
        SAR-->>WT: Signed response
        WT->>Peers: Pong
    end

    Peers->>WT: Signed PSBT
    WT->>Bitcoin Network: Broadcast transaction
```

### What Makes It Non-Deterministic (But Bounded)

Each Boomlet draws a secret integer (“mystery”) during setup.

Importantly:

- Each peer selects, at setup time, a **minimum and maximum range** (in blocks) that defines acceptable withdrawal latency.
- The Boomlet then samples a random integer uniformly from within that user-selected range.
- The exact mystery value is stored only inside the secure element and is never revealed.
- Other peers do not know each other’s mystery values.
- The Watchtower does not know any mystery value.

During withdrawal:

- Each Boomlet maintains a counter.
- The counter advances only under valid block-height and freshness constraints inside the coordinated ping-pong loop.
- Signing becomes available only when the Boomlet’s internal counter reaches its mystery threshold.

Therefore:

- Withdrawal duration is **bounded** (by the selected range),
- But the exact completion time is **unpredictable** to any participant or adversary.

Boomerang enforces *bounded unpredictability*, not unbounded delay.

----

## Duress Signaling

Duress signaling is designed to be:

* **unavoidable** (recurs during withdrawal),
* **plausibly deniable** (no observable protocol divergence),
* **hardware-evaluated** (Boomlet is the trusted evaluator, ST is the trusted UI).

At setup, the user selects and memorizes a **consent pattern** (e.g., a set of countries). During withdrawal:

* Boomlet generates randomized challenges.
* ST displays them air-gapped.
* The user’s selection either matches the consent set (safe) or does not (duress).

Boomlet then produces a **duress placeholder** included in normal messages:

* Safe: an encrypted zero/padding placeholder
* Duress: an encrypted key that allows SAR to unlock the user’s encrypted doxing data

WT forwards these placeholders to SAR, and SAR responds with a signed acknowledgment while keeping protocol flow consistent.

----

## Security Model

Boomerang aims to increase attacker uncertainty and create a reaction window. It does **not** claim to eliminate coercion risk.

Assumptions (non-exhaustive):

* Secure element (Boomlet) resists key extraction and behaves correctly.
* ST is tamper-resistant/evident enough to preserve integrity of user verification and duress input.
* Cryptographic primitives hold.
* WT is non-custodial but is a coordination actor (liveness + metadata exposure).
* SAR operates under real-world legal constraints and only learns identity upon duress signal.

----

## Trade-offs

Boomerang intentionally trades simplicity for coercion resistance:

| Property                        | Cost                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enforced non-determinism        | Potentially long withdrawal latency                       |
| Embedded duress signaling       | Additional devices and ceremony complexity                |
| N-of-N Boomerang regime         | Coordination burden; peer non-cooperation blocks progress |
| Eventual deterministic recovery | Requires milestone planning and rollover discipline       |
| External services (WT/SAR)      | Operational trust and metadata exposure (not custody)     |

Boomerang is optimized for long-term holdings, not frequent spending.

----

## Limitations And Open Problems

Boomerang is research-stage; several issues are explicitly open:

### 1) Forced determinism

Boomerang can collapse into the deterministic regime if:

* a Boomlet is lost/destroyed,
* the backup path is unavailable,
* withdrawal is initiated too late relative to milestones,
* or a peer refuses to cooperate.

Mitigation today relies on disciplined rollover and operational guidance. More robust mitigations remain open research.

### 2) Peer non-cooperation

N-of-N preserves the coercion-resistance promise (one honest peer can prevent “silent bypass”), but it increases liveness risk.

### 3) Hardware trust

Security depends heavily on secure element behavior (RNG, side-channel resistance, lifecycle, supply chain). Compromise of Boomlet undermines the non-determinism guarantee.

### 4) SAR trust + legal/jurisdiction constraints

SAR intervention is jurisdiction-dependent and introduces legal exposure. Incentives, abuse resistance, and privacy implications require careful treatment.

### 5) Complexity as attack surface

The protocol is a distributed state machine with many checks. Complexity increases the risk of emergent failure modes and usability errors.

## Closing Thought

Bitcoin has spent years hardening keys against math, networks, and software.

Boomerang asks:

> What does it look like to harden Bitcoin custody against humans with guns — by making **time** uncertain?

This repository is an exploration of that question. It is intentionally adversarial, intentionally strict, and intentionally unfinished.

## Updates

None for now.
