# Setup no-prose guards

Calls beginning with `GS-` in the setup no-prose diagram expand to the exact
conditions below.

## Duress input

`GS-DURESS-SELECTION(selection, columns)` requires:

```text
count(selection) == count(columns)
count(selection) == 5
selection contains exactly one displayed choice from each columns column
each selection value exists in its corresponding columns column
```

`GS-DURESS-INDEXES(indices)` requires:

```text
count(indices) == 5
indices are distinct
indices are in range [1..193]
```

`GS-DURESS-RESPONSE(response, nonce)` requires:

```text
response.nonce == nonce
GS-DURESS-INDEXES(response.content.indices)
```

`GS-DURESS-CONFIRM(response, nonce, space, consent)` requires:

```text
GS-DURESS-RESPONSE(response, nonce)
space.space[response.content.indices] == consent
```

## Peer agreement

`GS-SIGNED-CONTENT(collection, expected, range)` requires every signed value
selected by `range` from `collection` to have content equal to `expected`.

`GS-SETUP-CHECKPOINTS(collection, checkpoint)` expands to:

```text
GS-SIGNED-CONTENT(collection, checkpoint, [1 <= i <= 4])
```

The diagram's following collection assignment remains part of the operation;
this guard only abbreviates its repeated equality checks.

## External receipts

`GS-WT-RECEIPT(receipt, setup_id, fingerprint)` requires:

```text
receipt.content.setup_instance_id == setup_id
receipt.content.boomerang_params_fingerprint == fingerprint
```

`GS-SAR-PAYLOAD(payload, setup_id, identifier)` requires:

```text
payload.setup_instance_id == setup_id
payload.doxing_data_identifier == identifier
```
