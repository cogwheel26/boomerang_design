# Boomerang Glossary

This glossary translates Boomerang’s internal names into plain language. It is intentionally short. The protocol specification remains the authority for exact behavior.

## Big-picture terms

| Term | Plain meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Boomerang** | A research-stage Bitcoin custody protocol that makes the primary withdrawal path bounded but unpredictable in time and includes hidden emergency signaling. |
| **Coercion-aware custody** | Custody design that considers a person being pressured, threatened, or forced to participate, not only remote key theft. |
| **Bounded unpredictability** | The withdrawal cannot take forever, but nobody knows the exact moment when it will become signable. |
| **Time determinism** | The property that a withdrawal has a known or easy-to-estimate completion time. Boomerang treats this as an attack surface. |
| **Ceremony** | A multi-step operational process involving humans, devices, and services. Setup and withdrawal are both ceremonies. |
| **Primary path** | The Boomerang withdrawal path: stricter, slower, less predictable, and dependent on Boomlets. |
| **Fallback path** | Later timelocked normal-key spending paths that preserve recoverability if the primary path cannot complete. |
| **Research-stage** | The design is being explored and reviewed. It is not ready for production funds. |

## Actors and components

| Term | Plain meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Peer** | One member of the custody group. In the current design profile, Boomerang assumes five peers. |
| **User** | The human operating one peer’s devices. |
| **Boomlet** | The active secure element or smartcard-like device. Its key share is unavailable to the host and may be exported only inside the authenticated backup envelope for an authorized Boomletwo. It also tracks withdrawal progress, enforces the mystery threshold, and evaluates emergency-signal challenges. |
| **Boomletwo** | A backup secure element. Its activation and lifecycle details are still design work. |
| **Iso** | The isolated/offline environment used for sensitive operations such as normal-key derivation and final signing. |
| **Niso** | The networked environment used for coordination, peer communication, Bitcoin node access, and Watchtower interaction. |
| **ST / Secure Terminal** | An air-gapped human interface for checking transaction details and answering emergency-signal challenges. Its job is to reduce trust in networked computers. |
| **WT / Watchtower** | A coordination service. It relays messages, helps track liveness and block height, and aggregates final signed fragments. It is not supposed to custody funds. |
| **SAR / Search and Rescue** | A real-world response service. It receives encrypted placeholders and interprets them only if they contain a valid duress signal. Its legal and operational model is jurisdiction-dependent. |
| **Phone** | The user device used to register encrypted rescue information with SAR and update dynamic rescue information. |

## Keys and on-chain structure

| Term | Plain meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Taproot output** | The Bitcoin output that holds the funds and contains the Boomerang and fallback spending branches. |
| **Descriptor** | A precise description of the spending policy for the Bitcoin output. |
| **Normal key** | A recoverable key backed by mnemonic/passphrase material. It is used in fallback paths and as one part of a Boomerang key. |
| **Boom key share** | A key share generated and held inside Boomlet. It is never exposed in plaintext or to the host; the only permitted export is the encrypted, target-bound Boomletwo backup. |
| **Boom pubkey** | The combined public key for a peer’s Boomerang signing role, produced from the normal key and Boomlet-held share. |
| **MuSig2** | A multisignature-style signing method used to aggregate signing keys. The exact implementation profile belongs in the spec and implementation docs. |
| **Timelock** | A Bitcoin rule that prevents a branch from being spendable until a specified block height or time condition. |
| **Milestone block** | A block height at which a new spending branch becomes available or a protocol stage becomes valid. |
| **Waterfall fallback** | A sequence of later fallback branches whose required signer threshold gradually decreases over time. |

---

## Withdrawal terms

| Term | Plain meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Withdrawal** | The process of moving funds out of the Boomerang output. |
| **PSBT** | Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction. A standard way to coordinate transaction review and signing before final broadcast. |
| **Commitment** | The point where peers bind themselves to a specific transaction identity so later steps cannot silently become a different withdrawal. |
| **Hydration** | Filling in the final transaction/signing details after the waiting process is complete. Boomlet must verify continuity with the committed transaction. |
| **Ping / pong** | Repeated progress messages between Boomlets, peers, and Watchtower during the waiting loop. |
| **Freshness** | Evidence that a message belongs to the current withdrawal and is not a stale replay from an earlier state. |
| **Counter** | A Boomlet’s internal progress value during withdrawal. |
| **Mystery** | The Boomlet’s secret threshold. When the internal counter reaches this value, the Boomlet becomes ready to sign. |
| **Reached mystery flag** | The device state saying its mystery threshold has been reached. Once true, it should not revert to false for that ceremony. |
| **Fail closed** | Refuse to advance the current Boomerang ceremony when checks fail. This prevents unsafe progress but may require recovery or fallback planning. |

## Emergency-signal terms

| Term | Plain meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Duress** | A situation where a user is not acting freely. The design tries to let the user signal this without making the signal visible to the attacker or other protocol observers. |
| **Consent pattern** | The memorized answer pattern that means “I am safe; continue.” In the current design, this is represented with a set of countries. |
| **Challenge** | A prompt shown by the Secure Terminal during withdrawal. The user’s answer is evaluated by the Boomlet. |
| **Duress placeholder** | An encrypted payload included in ordinary protocol messages. It should look structurally normal whether the user is safe or signaling duress. |
| **Safe placeholder** | A placeholder that decrypts to inert material, such as zeros or padding. |
| **Duress placeholder with unlock material** | A placeholder that gives SAR enough information to identify and decrypt the user’s encrypted rescue information. |
| **Rescue information** | The information SAR would need to identify and help the user in an emergency. |
| **Plausible deniability** | The property that the visible protocol flow does not obviously reveal whether the user signaled safe or duress. |

## Risk terms

| Term | Plain meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Forced determinism** | A failure mode where the system is pushed out of the unpredictable Boomerang path and into the predictable fallback path. This can happen through lost hardware, non-cooperation, or starting too late. |
| **Liveness** | The ability of the system to eventually complete a valid withdrawal or recovery. |
| **Recoverability** | The ability to regain access to funds after loss, failure, or non-cooperation. |
| **Metadata exposure** | Information leaked by timing, communication patterns, service usage, peer identities, or operational behavior, even when keys remain safe. |
| **Trust boundary** | A place where the system relies on a component or actor to behave correctly. Boomlet, Secure Terminal, Watchtower, SAR, Iso, Niso, and Phone each create different boundaries. |
| **Assumption register** | The project document that lists important assumptions and design gaps. It is useful for reviewers who want to separate claims from dependencies. |

## Acronym quick list

| Acronym | Expands to | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ST** | Secure Terminal | Air-gapped user interface |
| **WT** | Watchtower | Coordination and liveness service |
| **SAR** | Search and Rescue | Emergency-response service |
| **PSBT** | Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction | Transaction coordination format |
| **PoC** | Proof of Concept | Experimental implementation, not production code |

## One-sentence summary

Boomerang is a research design where Bitcoin funds are recoverable, but the preferred withdrawal path cannot be made predictably fast merely because a human is pressured.
