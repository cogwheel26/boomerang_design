# Self-contained Ping checks

These finite checks evaluate the DIGGING threshold policies in
[the proposal](boomlet_rollover.md). They assume a valid authenticated checkpoint
for one withdrawal and one common unit of valid counter progress. They do not
establish real elapsed block time, latest-state recovery or device exclusion.

Run from the repository root. No files are created or diagrams rendered.

The threshold search covers positive uniform supports with upper bound at most
20, every unreached original draw, saved counter, possible later unreached
counter and independent replacement draw. The algebraic inequalities in the
proposal establish the same bound beyond this finite range, assuming a common
progress unit and an authentic counter. The four histories illustrate missing
information; they are not a model of a complete recovery protocol.
