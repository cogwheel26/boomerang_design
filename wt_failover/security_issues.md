# WT failover security review

The findings apply to the proposed `WT_FAILOVER_V1` profile. The proposal,
[wire contract](wire_contract.md), [resource limits](resource_limits.md), and
sequence diagrams specify its behavior. The base single-WT specification keeps
its own profile; WT dispatch is version-bound while designated backup
authorization and setup export boundaries are inherited. Protocol and device implementation evidence remains necessary.

| Finding | Severity | Required control | Proposal location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Pre-DIGGING closure loses a rescue signal | Critical | Discharge every frozen placeholder before initial activation PREPARE; bind exact closure scope and all five obligation records | README 4.2, 5.2, 5.3, 7.3 |
| 2. Cloned or stale backup equivocates | Critical | Preserve designated inactive backup; require exclusive authority and complete history before activation; lost-source activation remains open | README 3.3; rollover 6 |
| 3. Deactivated WT retains wire authority | High | Separate setup-selected version, exact head wrapper and channel dispatch, current-index validation, explicit historical-evidence handler | Wire contract; README 3.2, 7.4 |
| 4. Fragment export destroys recovery evidence | High | Persist exact fragment before export; keep public progress until complete transaction verification and own discharge; retain own fragment until setup retirement | README 9 |
| 5. Timeout races deliberate SAR delay | Medium | Both height silence and elapsed time exceeding SAR, processing, routing and observation budgets; exact in-flight discharge | Resource limits; README 4.1, 5.2 |
| 6. Historical freshness exception is too broad | Medium | Enumerate the two historical commit and gate age exceptions; retain every other authorization, chain, head and SAR check | README 7.4 |
| 7. Parsing, ballot and storage exhaustion | Medium | Fixed ceilings, trusted admission, one obligation slot, fixed journal and archives, successor-only ballots, protected duplicate results | Resource limits |
| 8. Threat-model integration is required | Medium | Incorporate profile-specific assumptions, attack paths, audit mappings and operational duties during adoption | security_requirements.md |
| 9. Host substitutes recovery bytes after authentication | High | Authenticate the exact retained ciphertext before decryption and bind it to the signed Ping and designated target | Rollover 1; verification SV-01 |
| 10. Oversized or repeatedly replayed checkpoints exhaust resources | Medium | Fixed schema, padding, byte limits and one-time recovery admission; exact encoding remains open | Rollover 1, 7; verification SV-02 |
| 11. Colluding observers fabricate chain progress | High | Specify authenticated chain observation for the honest Boomlet; current real-chain delay guarantee remains blocked | README 1; verification SV-03 |
| 12. Conflicting intent locks prevent recovery | Medium | Preserve first locks and document fallback; later cooperation alone cannot reconcile them | README 6.6; verification SV-04 |
| 13. Independent redraw lowers delay or creates a second trial | Critical | Preserve an original-threshold floor or use upper-bound plus fresh draw; prevent parallel authority; no raw redraw against restored counter | Rollover 3, 6; verification SV-06 |

## Review boundaries

The rescue controls require each signer to discharge its own frozen placeholder
before PREPARE. Activation votes bind the common obligation vector, and ABORT
preserves completed discharges. Initialized withdrawals and exported fragments
remain recoverable until their normal completion guards hold.

The [checkpoint candidate](boomlet_rollover.md) uses the designated offline
backup and has no continuously online ST dependency. Its encrypted snapshot
provides authenticated state at one point, not proof of latest state or source
exclusion. Independent redraw and stale-state counterexamples remain explicit.
The delay floors do not complete activation or repair missing rescue duties.

All-five cooperation, fixed resource ceilings, SAR and chain availability, and
device integrity limit availability. The [verification report](security_verification.md)
contains the security argument, model results, and remaining blockers. The
[integration requirements](security_requirements.md) define the assumptions and
audit work required for adoption.
